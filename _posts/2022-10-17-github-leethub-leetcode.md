Found a very useful app to track your LeetCode and contribute to your GitHub repo at the same time - [LeetHub](https://github.com/QasimWani/LeetHub) is the answer!

Install chrome extension using the following [link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leethub/aciombdipochlnkbpcbgdpjffcfdbggi/related)

Once installed, log in to your GitHub account and start tracking LeetCode problems as Git repository!
